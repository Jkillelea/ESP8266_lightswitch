# ESP8266 Lightswitch
## Turns my lights on and off via an HTML request

Not much more to add than that. In the future I'd like to set an interrupt pin
(if the 8266 can do that) so the lights can be turned on and off with a button too.

Right now it's switching some LEDs with a MOSFET but the general idea transfers
over to anything, more or less.
